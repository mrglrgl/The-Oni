At her core, The Celestial is a hybrid Tank/Disruptor. Her heaven-forged body grants immense passive damage absorption, and she can draw attention to herself with ease. On the offense she unleashes devastating attacks with her divine sword and stones, sundering armor and sending formations reeling.

However, one must be careful. The Celestial is arrogant and excitable, prone to outbursts of reckless power. While this allows her to effortlessly swap between offense and defense, it can also leave her vulnerable at crucial moments. Managing her [b]Exhilaration[/b] is key to success.
